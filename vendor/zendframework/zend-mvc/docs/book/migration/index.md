# Migration

While we strive to keep functionality backwards compatible between releases,
occasionally we need to break features in order to fix critical or security
issues. Additionally, in order to signal upcoming changes, we will introduce
deprecation notices or add forwards-compatibility features to assist you in
migration.

The chapters in this section document these changes.

- [Migrating from v2.X to v2.7](to-v2-7.md)
- [Migrating to v3.0](to-v3-0.md)
